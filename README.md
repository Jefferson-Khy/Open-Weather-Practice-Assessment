# Open-Weather-Practice-Assessment

This is my attempt at the frontend practice assessment linked below:

https://hatchways.notion.site/hatchways/Front-End-Practice-Assessment-0a0723b34cae4e41912ff6bf5b7c2b77

I Used React, Javascript, HTML/CSS, AXIOS


To run the app: 
- clone the repo into a folder and open in vscode
- type yarn install in terminal 
- sign up for open weather api to get api key
- insert api key in the weatherService.js file
- then yarn start to get the next 5 day forecast. (I hardcoded the location to find the weather of OC California.)
